; admin_filter.clsp
; for DataLayer.storage by yakuhito

;; Allows the data store owner to add admins that:
;;  - CAN update the store root hash, label, description, and any other metadata
;;    (i.e., call the metadata updatter via the -24 condition)
;;  - CAN update the authorized puzzles list
;;    (i.e., can add other authorized writers and admins, alter oracle address/fees, etc. by using te -13 condition)
;;  - CANNOT remove the owner
;;    (i.e., output CREATE_COIN that could delete the one_of_many layer)
;;
;; Warning: This filter only works for the default data layer metadata updater (11).
